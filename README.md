Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the application of engineering principles,methods and tools to developand maintain high quality software systems.
it is importnat to the technology industry because it enables creation of software applicationsand systems that power various aspects of life like communication,entrertainement.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

the intoduction of the first programing languages like forton and c in the 1960s
introduction of programming as a disciple
recognition of pioneering people like Allan Turing,Grace Hopper and Fred Brooks.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

requirements-gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
design-creating high level and deatiled   designs of the software architecture and user interface
implementation-writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
testing-conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality.
deployment-release of software to the users or consumers
maintance-proving ongoing support,updates and enhancementsto the software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall methodology refers to sequencial approach with distint phases. while agile methodology refers to iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibilty ,collaboration and responding to change .waterfall technology would work best with smaller projects where the project scope is relatively small and managable while agile metholodology work with uncertain or evolvimg requirements thats when the requirements are likely to change during development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing softare.
quality assuarance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
project manager oversees the planning ,execution ,delivering of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs help with providing comprehensive tools for writing ,degugging and testing code.exaples are visual studio,eclipse .
VCs help with tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members .examples are GIT and 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

changing requirements that leads to scope creep and project delays.
tight deadlne that leads to compromised quality
techical debt that accrue from shortcuts.
strategies to recover these challanges are:having effective communications,using agile methodology,regular reassesment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit testing is testing individual components or modules of software
intergration is tesing interactions between different components 
sysytem testing is testing an entire software sysstem as a whole
acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts that guide AI models to generate desired ouputs.
it is important in interacting with Ai models ensure clarity and specifity,efficiency,ethical consideration and to control over output from the AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt;how doesagriculture improve lives in kenya?
clear,specific and consise prompt:site benefits a female farmer in kenya ,nyandarua county,gets from farming potatoes and selling to co-opereatives or retail farming?
the improved prompt is more effective because it allows the AI to give more especic and effective results.
